/*  BEGIN CRITICAL SECTION  */
/*
		 You will modify the program so that client_MP6.cpp
		 populates the request buffer using 3 request threads
		 instead of sequentially in a loop, and likewise
		 processes requests using w worker threads instead of
		 sequentially in a loop.

		 Note that in the finished product, as in this initial code,
		 all the requests will be pushed to the request buffer
		 BEFORE the worker threads begin processing them. This means
		 that you will have to ensure that all 3 request threads
		 have terminated before kicking off any worker threads.
		 In the next machine problem, we will deal with the
		 synchronization problems that arise from allowing the
		 request threads and worker threads to run in parallel
		 with each other. In the meantime, see if you can figure
		 out the limitations of this machine problem's approach (*cough*stack overflow,
		 as in not the Q&A site*coughcough*).

		 Just to be clear: for this machine problem, request
		 threads will run concurrently with request threads, and worker
		 threads will run concurrently with worker threads, but request
		 threads will NOT run concurrently with worker threads.

		 While gathering data for your report, it is recommended that you comment
		 out all the output operations occurring between when you
		 start the timer and when you end the timer. Output operations
		 are very time-intensive (at least compared to the other operations 
		 we're doing) and will skew your results.
